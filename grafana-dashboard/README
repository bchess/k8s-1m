The terraform in k8s-1m does deploy victoraimetrics (see RUNNING), but does not
deploy an instance of Grafana. You will need to deploy one outside of this
project, or use Grafana Cloud.

Included in this directory is an extensive dashboard useful for monitoring the
Kubernetes control plane, mem_etcd, dist-scheduler, and nodes in general.

This dashboard was used with Grafana v11.4.0, VictoriaMetrics v1.107.0, and VictoriaLogs v1.19.0.
